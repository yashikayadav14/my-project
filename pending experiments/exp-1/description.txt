This HTML document represents a basic student registration form designed for the BYTE XL platform. It is structured using standard HTML5 syntax and serves as a simple web page that collects essential student information.

1. Document Structure

The document starts with the declaration <!DOCTYPE html>, which specifies that the page is written in HTML5.

The HTML code is enclosed within <html>...</html> tags, containing two main sections:

The head section

The body section

2. Head Section

The <head> tag contains metadata and external resource links for the page.

<title>BYTE XL Registration</title> sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser’s tab.

The <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> line connects an external CSS file named style.css, allowing you to style and format the page separately (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing, alignment).

3. Body Section

The <body> tag contains the visible content displayed to users.

A heading <h2>Student Registration</h2> is used to clearly indicate the purpose of the page.

The form is created using the <form> tag, which defines a section where users can input their data.

4. Form Details

Inside the form, three input fields are provided:

Name:

<input type="text" name="name" required>


This field allows the user to enter their name.

The required attribute ensures the field cannot be left blank.

Email:

<input type="email" name="email" required>


This field accepts the user’s email address.

The type="email" ensures that the entered value follows a valid email format.

Age:

<input type="number" name="age" required>


This field takes a numeric input for the student’s age.

The required attribute ensures that an age must be provided.

After the fields, a submit button is included:

<input type="submit" value="Register">


When clicked, this button submits the entered data.

By default, the form will send data using the GET method to the same page unless another method or action is specified.

5. Purpose

This registration form can be used as part of a student enrollment system or a training program registration portal for BYTE XL. It provides a simple interface for collecting basic user information before saving it into a database or processing it further through server-side scripts (like PHP, Python, or ASP.NET).

6. Extensibility

You can easily extend this form by:

Adding more fields (e.g., gender, course, contact number).

Applying CSS styling for better design.

Connecting it to a backend server to handle and store submissions.
