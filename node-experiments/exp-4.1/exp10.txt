This program is a simple command-line Employee Management System written in Node.js using the built-in readline module.
It allows you to add, list, and remove employees interactively from the terminal.

How It Works

Menu Interface

When you run the script, it shows a text menu with four options:

Add Employee

List Employees

Remove Employee

Exit

User input is read through the readline interface.

Add Employee

Prompts for an employee’s name and ID.

Checks for duplicate IDs to avoid conflicts.

Stores each employee as an object { name, id } inside the employees array.

List Employees

Displays all employees with their name and ID.

If there are no employees, it shows a “No employees found” message.

Remove Employee

Prompts for an employee ID.

Searches the employees array and removes the matching record if found.

Exit

Gracefully closes the application.
