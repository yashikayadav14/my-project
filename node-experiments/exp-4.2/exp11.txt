*This project is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.
It provides endpoints to view, add, and delete playing cards stored in an in-memory array.

How It Works

GET /cards

Returns a JSON list of all cards.

GET /cards/:id

Returns a single card that matches the numeric id in the URL.

Responds with a 404 status if the card doesnâ€™t exist.

POST /cards

Accepts a JSON body with suit and value (e.g., { "suit": "Clubs", "value": "Jack" }).

Creates a new card with a unique incremental id.

Responds with HTTP 201 and the newly added card.

DELETE /cards/:id

Removes the card with the given id.

Returns the deleted card object or a 404 error if not found.
